Git rebase merge is good practice. This demo shows how to handle merge conflicts.

Unzip `initialsetup.zip` to create 2 user directories (`homer` and `lisa`) as well as a simulated server (`myApp.git`).

Use code similar to `script/create_merge_conflict.sh` to create a merge conflict.
Instructions on how to resolve the merge conflict are present in the file.
